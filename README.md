# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
I've been tasked with the job of sorting, compiling, and presenting the data of average fare prices for urban, suburban, and rural cities.
The purpose of conducting this research is to hopefully find a trend between the amount ride-sharing apps charge and the city type the customer is located

## Results
After conducting the averages for ride-sharing between city types, It is clear that the total fares for urban cities are a lot more than the total fare for suburban and rural cities. This is mainly due to the larger customer base and the much larger percentage in the total amount of drivers.

## Summary
After conducting the analysis, here are my business solutions:
1. offer insentives for rural customers to use the rideharing service since there is a smaller amount of drivers in those regions which forces these customers to pay more per ride which is disencouraging customers from using the service.
2. The business should spend resources in developing the number of drivers in suburban and rural cities. Currently, urban markets are oversaturated with drivers which will make it harder for individual drivers to make a living where on the other hand, there is a driver deficit in the other markets where they need more drivers to grow the service.
