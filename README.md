# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
I've been tasked with the job of sorting, compiling, and presenting the data of average fare prices for urban, suburban, and rural cities.
The purpose of conducting this research is to hopefully find a trend between the amount ride-sharing apps charge and the city type the customer is located

## Results
After conducting the averages for ride-sharing between city types, It is clear that the total fares for urban cities are a lot more than the total fare for suburban and rural cities. This is mainly due to the larger customer base and the much larger percentage in the total amount of drivers.

Because of the abundance of drivers in urban cities, it is only natural that they also have the majority of the total number of rides

In the figure below, it shows how urban cities produce Pyber's largest revenue stream with urban cities taking 62.7% of the total fares. This also makes sense considering the last 2 figures pointing to this conclusion

Below is the summary of the total fare by each city time over a period of time (jan 1st- Apr 28th)

## Summary
After conducting the analysis, here are my business recomendatons:
1. offer insentives for rural customers to use the rideharing service since there is a smaller amount of drivers in those regions which forces these customers to pay more per ride which is disencouraging customers from using the service.
2. The business should spend resources in developing the number of drivers in suburban and rural cities. Currently, urban markets are oversaturated with drivers which will make it harder for individual drivers to make a living where on the other hand, there is a driver deficit in the other markets where they need more drivers to grow the service.
3. If competition in urban cities are driving costs so low in which drivers cannot earn enough to justify driving, then alternative ways to generate revenues from urban customers must be implemented in order to remain cometitive. An example of this would be to sell ad space on the mobile app to offset the cost of lowing fare prices to remain competitive for both Pyber and the drivers
4. My final recomendation is create driver incentives to try and get current drivers to work in less occupied places, while also trying to convince drivers of other ride-share companies to switch over to Pyber.
